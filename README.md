# SortedCheckoutKata
Checkout Kata for Sorted

The following nuget packages must be installed for the project for the projects:

Dapper(v2.0.30) (only required in the SortedCheckoutKata project)
System.Data.SQLite.Core (v1.0.112)

If you get an "Unable to load DLL 'SQLite.Interop.dll'" error or the unit tests won't run, change the target build to x86/x64 as required (apologies for any inconvenience).
